\section*{Problem 2}
    \textbf{\underline{1-to-2 PARTITION}}:\\
    \underline{Instance}: A finite set of positive integers Z = { z1 , z2 , ... , zn }.\\
    \underline{Question}: Is there a subset Z' of Z such that
    Sum of all numbers in Z' = 2 x Sum of all numbers in Z-Z'\\
    
    \noindent
    (a) Obtain the dynamic programming functional equation to solve the 1-to-2 PARTITION problem.\\
    (b) Give an algorithm to implement your functional equation.\\
    (c) Give an example of 5 numbers with a total of 21 as an input instance for 1-to-2 PARTITION
    
     problem, and show how your algorithm works on this input instance.\\
    (d) What is the complexity of your algorithm?\\
