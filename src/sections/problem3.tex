\section*{Problem 3}
	Decide True or False for each of the followings. You MUST briefly justify your answer.\\
	
	\noindent
	\textbf{\underline{Satisfiability}:}\\
	\underline{Instance}: Set U of variables, collection C of clauses over U.\\
	\underline{Question}: Is there a satisfying truth assignment for C?\\
	
	\noindent
	(a) If P $\neq$ NP, then no problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time deterministically.\\
	(b) If a decision problem A is NP-complete, proving that A is reducible to B, in polynomial time, is
	
	 sufficient to show that B is NP-complete.\\
	(c) It is known that SAT (Satisfiability) is NP-complete, and 3SAT (all clauses have size 3) is
	
	 NP-complete. 1SAT (all clauses have size 1) is also NP-complete.
